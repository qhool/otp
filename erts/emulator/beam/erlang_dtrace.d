/*
 * A note on probe naming: if "__" appears in a provider probe
 * definition, then two things happen during compilation:
 *
 *    1. The "__" will turn into a hypen, "-", for the probe name.
 *    2. The "__" will turn into a single underscore, "_", for the
 *       macro names and function definitions that the compiler and
 *       C developers will see.
 *
 * We'll try to use the following naming convention.  We're a bit
 * limited because, as a USDT probe, we can only specify the 4th part
 * of the probe name, e.g. erlang*:::mumble.  The 2nd part of the
 * probe name is always going to be "beam" or "beam.smp", and the 3rd
 * part of the probe name will always be the name of the function
 * that's calling the probe.
 *
 * So, all probes will be have names defined in this file using the
 * convention category__name or category__sub_category__name.  This
 * will translate to probe names of category-name or
 * category-sub_category-name.
 * 
 * Each of "category", "sub_category", and "name" may have underscores
 * but may not have hyphens.
